# Light Hosting Kube

Automated Kubernetes setup using Hetzner Cloud, Terraform, Ansible &amp; Rancher.

## Requirements

- Terraform 0.12
- Hetzner Cloud account
- CloudFlare account

## Inspirations

Light Hosting Kube is the third iteration of my personal hosting setup.

The previous iteration used terraform and ansible to provision, harden and configure a Kubernetes cluster hosted with Hetzner. It included a lot of manual work, managing the servers and ansible roles.

After having read [Vito Botta](https://github.com/vitobotta)'s article [From zero to Kubernetes in Hetzner Cloud with Terraform, Ansible and Rancher](https://vitobotta.com/2019/10/14/kubernetes-hetzner-cloud-terraform-ansible-rancher/) where he used Rancher to configure the Kubernetes cluster, I wanted to recreate my setup in a similar fashion, using Ubuntu servers, and adding CloudFlare DNS on top.

## Instructions

To be written.
